I am a Digital Infrastructure and Cybersecurity student at NTNU with an interest for cybersecurity and work part-time as a security analyst in a cybersecurity firm.
In my spare time I enjoy participating in CTF's, working out and fiddling with stuff I get a hangup on.  

- 🔭 I have a bachelor's degree in Digital Infrastructure and Cybersecurity. My bachelor's thesis explored the use of generative AI in offensive testing of security software.
-  I am currently taking a master's degree in Information Security, with a specialization within the Technology track. 
- Besides tasks related to school, I enjoy customizing my environment to my liking and creating tools for better quality of life. 
<!-- - 🌱 I’m currently learning further sophisticating and obfuscating our exploitation attempts, testing out different LLM's and their use in offensive security operations. -->
<!-- - 🤔 I’m looking for help with -->
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been through both the healthcare sector and worked in a tinsmithing firm before my passion for cybersecurity lit up.
- 👨‍💻 I've participated in EPT (Equinor) CTF, BSides Oslo CTF and multiple others online and on-campus. I also spend time going through HTB content and still experience a rising interest for offensive security.
