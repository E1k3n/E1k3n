### Hi there 👋
#### Welcome to my GitHub page!
##### whoami
I am a Digital Infrastructure and Cybersecurity student at NTNU with an interest for cybersecurity and work part-time as a security analyst in a cybersecurity firm.
In my spare time I enjoy participating in CTF's, 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my bachelor's thesis about use of generative AI in testing of security software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning further sophisticating and obfuscating our exploitation attempts, testing out different LLM's and their use in offensive security operations.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... Detection avoidance?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been through both the healthcare sector and worked in a tinsmithing firm before my passion for cybersecurity lit up.
